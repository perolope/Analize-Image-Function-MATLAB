# Analize-Image-Function-MATLAB
Code developed for single molecule localization microscope in IBEC (Institut de Bioenginyeria de Catalunya).
The repository contains 4 documents, the PDF is the paper of my final degree project where I apply succesfully 
this code to analyse data from single molecule microscope using an image of a low-res microscope as a mask.

There are 3 MATLAB codes, the READCOORDS2 is a code developed by Pietro Delcanale (my supervisor) I made some little 
changes but primarly all the code is written by him.

The 2 other MATLAB codes are the analize image functions for one layer or for more than one (maximum 3), 
these functions are better detailed inside the file, but to summarize what they do is, receiving the data of 
the localizations and the image of the microscopes, you select your ROI (regions of interest) and the 
program returns you the number of localizations inside, the density, ...

These can be useful to apply cluster and correlation methods in a faster way.

Hope you can use this code in a succesfull way!
